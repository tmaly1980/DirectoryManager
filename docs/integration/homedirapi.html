<p style='text-indent: 16px'>The Home Directory Creation RPC Daemon being Perl requires that the home directory server be a UNIX server with Perl. In the case that your main file server is NOT a UNIX server, you can develop your own HTTP-form processing application (in Java, C++, etc.. on whatever platform your server is) to serve such requests.</p>

		
		The daemon must either function from a web server running as a CGI (it MUST run as a privileged user that can create home directories), or may function from a standalone service/process that listens on a port and properly serves HTTP POST requests.
<p style='text-indent: 16px'>The following parameters are provided AS HTTP POST PARAMETERS to the daemon:</p>

		  UID = The username (NOT ID#!)
		  GID = The primary group name (NOT ID#!)
		  DIR = The path of the home directory. If the home directory server is a separate server, this is POSSIBLY not the true path that must be used (in that case, simply hardcode the home directory based upon the username).
<p style='text-indent: 16px'>The following plain-text response content, and their respective code, (Don't forget the 'Content-Type: text/plain' header!) are given back to Directory Manager:</p>

		  Directory Created (200) = All is well
		  Directory exists but has wrong owner/group (500) = Directory needs to be manually fixed by an administrator due to improper permissions
		  Unauthorized (401) = Didn't provide login, or login wasn't correct
		  Must specify ALL parameters (UID, GID, DIR) (500) = Not all required parameters were passed
		  No commands specified in script (500) = The script was not properly configured to do anything in order to create the home directory
		  Error running command '$command': $error (500) = The commands in the script failed to run, probably due to an authorization issue on the server end (i.e. NOT being 'root', as the daemon SHOULD be)
<p style='text-indent: 16px'>The text is simply a message (in the HTTP content section) printed back on the screen of the Directory Manager client. It is the exact message code (200, 500, etc) that specifies success or failure.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 16px'>Remember, authentication is sent by Directory Manager, and should be implemented (i.e. Basic-Authentication) in the RPC Daemon.</p>
