	  Some types of entries have associations with other entries (such as a user with their auxiliary groups). 
	  
	  Selecting 'Always' will provide the ability to both see and edit these links inline. There is a significant performance penalty in enabling this for searching, viewing AND editing, so one can set this to 'On Edit Only' so it is enabled for edits but disabled otherwise. 
	  
	  If set to 'Never', there will be only a link which will open a new window for these other entires.
